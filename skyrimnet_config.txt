# SkyrimNet Chatterbox Configuration
# This file controls how voice generation settings work with SkyrimNet UI
# 
# For each setting below, you can choose:
# "default" = Use the built-in Chatterbox value (recommended for most users)
# "api" = Use the value sent from SkyrimNet UI (gives you full control)
#
# If you're not sure, leave everything as "default"

# TEMPERATURE: Controls how creative/random the voice sounds
# Lower = more predictable, Higher = more varied/expressive
# Range: 0.00 to 2.00, Recommended: 0.8
# Note: This uses the "linear" slider in SkyrimNet UI when set to "api"
temperature = default

# MIN_P: Modern way to control speech quality (newer method)  
# Lower = safer/stable speech, Higher = more creative but risky
# Range: 0.00 to 1.00, Recommended: 0.05, Set to 0.00 to disable
min_p = default

# TOP_P: Classic way to control speech variety (older method)
# Lower = more focused, Higher = more varied, 1.00 = disabled (recommended)
# Range: 0.00 to 1.00, Recommended: 1.00 (disabled)
top_p = default

# REPETITION_PENALTY: Stops the voice from repeating words too much
# 1.00 = no penalty, Higher = less repetition
# Range: 1.00 to 2.00, Recommended: 1.2
# Note: This uses the "confidence" slider in SkyrimNet UI when set to "api"
repetition_penalty = default

# CFG_WEIGHT: Controls speech pacing and guidance strength
# Lower = slower/deliberate pacing, Higher = faster/guided speech
# Range: 0.00 to 1.00, Recommended: 0.5, Speed optimized: 0.0
# Note: This uses the "cfg_scale" slider in SkyrimNet UI when set to "api"
cfg_weight = default

# EXAGGERATION: Controls emotion intensity and expression
# Lower = neutral/calm, Higher = dramatic/expressive
# Range: 0.00 to 2.00, Recommended: 0.5, Dramatic: 0.7+
# Note: This uses the "quadratic" slider in SkyrimNet UI when set to "api"
exaggeration = default


# Advanced users: You can also set specific values instead of "default" or "api"
# Examples:
# temperature = 0.9
# min_p = 0.03
# top_p = 0.8
# repetition_penalty = 1.3
# cfg_weight = 0.3
# exaggeration = 0.55

# Conditionals (latents) are cached to memory and disk by default.
# You probably do not want to change these.

# ENABLE_MEMORY_CACHE: Controls whether to use in-memory caching for faster repeated generation
# true = Use memory cache (faster for repeated audio), false = No memory cache
# Recommended: true (faster performance)

# ENABLE_DISK_CACHE: Controls whether to save generated audio to disk cache
# true = Save to disk cache (reuse across sessions), false = No disk cache
