# SkyrimNet XTTS (Zonos emulated) Voice Configuration
# 
# For each setting, choose:
#   "default" = Use recommended XTTS values (safest choice)
#   "api"     = Use values from SkyrimNet UI (advanced users)
#   number    = Set your own custom value (experts only)
#
# If unsure, leave everything as "default"

# TEMPERATURE: How creative/varied the voice sounds (0.0 to 2.0)
# Lower = more predictable, Higher = more expressive
# IMPORTANT: This uses the "linear" slider in SkyrimNet UI when set to "api"
temperature = default

# TOP_K: Voice quality vs creativity (1 to 100) 
# Lower = better quality but more boring
# IMPORTANT: This uses the "min_k" slider in SkyrimNet UI when set to "api"
top_k = default

# TOP_P: How selective word choices are (0.0 to 1.0)
# Lower = more predictable speech
top_p = default

# REPETITION_PENALTY: Prevents repeated words and "ums" (1.0 to 3.0)
# Higher = less repetition but may sound unnatural
# IMPORTANT: This uses the "confidence" slider in SkyrimNet UI when set to "api"
repetition_penalty = default

# SPEED: How fast the speech is (0.5 to 2.0)
# 1.0 = normal speed, higher may cause artifacts
# speaking_rate
speed = default


# Examples of custom values (advanced users):
# temperature = 0.9
# top_p = 0.8
# top_k: int = 50
# repetition_penalty = 1.5
